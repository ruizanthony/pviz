PVIZ: professional visualization tools
======================================

The PVIZ project provides a set of tools allowing easy and fast batch post-processing with paraview.
The emphasis of the PVIZ project is to help professionals in their everyday post-processing tasks.

For neophytes with post-processing with paraview, PVIZ provides the missing reference explaining how to use paraview in batch mode for practical problems.
For experts, using the macro provided in pviz enables to write compact post-processing scripts that are easily maintanable and re-usable for multiple practical problems.

  In a nutshell:
    I have over six years of experience in CFD and I have learned that batch post-processing is very important.
    Your post-processing tools must allow you to quickly undestand and present your simulation results.
    PVIZ is the result of all these years working as a scientist, optimizing my workflow to convert data into information.
    Using PVIZ saved me a lot of time and put the fun back into post-processing!
    I hope you will enjoy it too, and that it will help humanity face the great scientific challenges of today!
