  Submits a batch pviz job (for pviz_postPy, pviz_postPvsm or pviz_postPvsmWithPy)
  for a given host. A template batch file should be located in $PVIZ/personal/batch/\$host
  with the following keys:  PVIZ_CMD, PVIZ_NCPUS, PVIZ_PVSM, PVIZ_FILES
  See http://ruizanthony.net/pviz/docs/ or 
  $PVIZ/examples/batch/ember  for examples of batch files

  Usage: 
    pviz_qsub host  cmd           ncpus  pyOrPvsm                           files

  for instance:
    pviz_qsub ember pviz_postPy   64     $PVIZ/examples/simple/cut_z0.py    *.xmf
    pviz_qsub ember pviz_postPvsm 64     $PVIZ/personal/myCase/myState.pvsm *.xmf

  NOTE: you can also use this script to start an interactive session in client/server
  mode with pvserver:

  pviz_qsub ember 'mpirun -np' 64 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

  Then connect to first node (n42 in the example below, otherwise
  pvserver tells you which node to connect to after starting (Std.out))
  of your job in 'direct' connection from your laptop.
  You will probably need to use a port forwarding command with ssh
  to foward localhost:11111 to n45:11111 going through head node (ember here)

  ssh -L 11111:n42:11111 amruiz@ember
